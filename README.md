# 🪔 Diwali Sales Analysis

This project is about analyzing Diwali sales data using Python. I have used bar charts and graphs to understand how people shop during Diwali. The goal is to find out which age group, gender, state, and products had the highest sales.

## 📊 What I Did

- Loaded and cleaned the sales dataset  
- Grouped data by **Gender**, **Age Group**, **State**, **Occupation**, **Product Category**, etc.  
- Used `groupby()` and `sum()` to calculate total sales  
- Used **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib** to create bar plots  
- Changed individual bar colors for better visuals  
- Added labels on bars using `bar_label()`  
- Sorted and displayed top 10 states and products based on amount/orders  
- Improved the look of charts with `sns.set(rc={...})`
